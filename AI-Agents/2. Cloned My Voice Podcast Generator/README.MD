🚀 I Cloned My Voice To Scale Up My Content With Podcasts (Code)🚀



I'm excited to share a new AI agentic framework that I've been working on—one that harnesses the power of CrewAI and ElevenLabs to turn any article URL into a fully-fledged podcast narrative with your own cloned voice! 🎙️🤖



What It Does:

Dynamic Web Research: The app uses CrewAI to fetch and transform the text of an article into a compelling podcast narrative.



Seamless Text-to-Speech: The narrative is converted into professional-quality audio with my own voice using ElevenLabs' Text-to-Speech API.



User-Friendly Interface: With Streamlit, the entire process is presented in a sleek, interactive web app that updates you in real-time—from fetching text to finalizing your podcast!



Whether you're looking to innovate your content strategy, enhance your podcast production, or simply experiment with AI, this project showcases how modern tools can revolutionize traditional media.
